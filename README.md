# README.md — Birthday WhatsApp Automation

## Project Overview

This Python script automates sending **birthday wishes via WhatsApp Web** using contact information stored in an Excel file. It checks each entry for birthdays that match today's date and sends a personalized message through WhatsApp Web.

## File Structure

BirthdayWish/
├── birthdays.xlsx        # Excel file with name, DOB (DD-MM-YY), and phone number
├── wish by whatsapp.py   # Main Python script
└── README.md             # This file

## Features

- Reads an Excel file with columns: `Name`, `Date of Birth`, `Mobile Number`
- Sends instant WhatsApp messages using `pywhatkit`
- No scheduled delay — messages are sent immediately
- 60-second delay between each message to prevent blocking
- Closes WhatsApp Web tab automatically after sending

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `pywhatkit` library
- WhatsApp Web logged in on your default browser (Chrome/Edge)

## Installation

### 1. Install Python packages

    pip install pywhatkit pandas openpyxl

### 2. Ensure your `birthdays.xlsx` file follows this format:
